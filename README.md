FYI - this chapter of book is all about API's

Why are API's awesome again?
1. Application Programming interface aka API is a powerful piece of code that connects different software applications.
2. Our world is full of incompatible software apps so API's act as their social media and enable communication without the need for complex coding.

Like I said, it's all plug'n'play.

Two of the popular API architectures are REST and SOAP.
